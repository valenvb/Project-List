Project-List
============

A jQuery plugin for nicely displaying all your projects. Currently pulls data from GitHub and Bitbucket.

##Usage
At simplest usage, do

```
$('<containing element>').projectList('<username>')
```

and it will come out like this:

these wells (yes, mostly copied from bootstrap) will be appended to \<containing element\>
